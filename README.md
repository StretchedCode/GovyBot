# GovyBot

<h1>Welcome to Govy Bot.</h1>


GovyBot is a discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py library alongside a Postgres database.

I wanted to take a break from Web Development and seeing how it had been quite some time since I had written anything substantial in Python, alongside the fact that I was learning how to use SQL, I wanted to apply these skills in a practical manner and solidify my understanding of the basics of both these languages. 

As the idea of creating a discord bot was in my mind for quite some time, I decided that I would implement a bot that would leverage an API and write to a SQL database, the latter of which I had never done before. 

Additionally, I would containerize this application using docker and deploy it through AWS, but that is something that I will be doing at a later date.
